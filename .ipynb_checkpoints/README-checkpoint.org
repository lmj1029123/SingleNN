* SingleNN

To use this package, please make sure you have PyTorch, NumPy and C++ compiler installed.

The codes are included in the src directory and tutorial.org shows an example using this package. Before using the package, make sure to enter the SimpleNN directory and run

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python libsymf_builder.py
#+END_SRC

This will build a Python-C++ interface that uses the codes from SIMPLE-NN to generate fingerprints.
